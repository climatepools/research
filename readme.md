## Ideas
- Ad campaig showing grandkids talking to their grandparents about what it was like in the old days, and why they didn't do anything about it. Stories from around the world, located on a google map that shows present and future
    - Kids stories from the future world that show the loss
    - Emphasize empathy
    - Possible problems
        - What would people care about?
        - Are we past the point when we doubt? Can we now address the feeling
          of helplessness?
        - How do we write a campaign that helps future people, in the same way
          we donate to help kids now?
